**eXtensible Disturbance Analytics dDExport**

# Overview
The OpenXDA dDExport feature was developed to provide the OpenXDA service with a way of transfering processed data to another instance of OpenXDA, locally or remotely.  This 
gives companies the ability to share data with other companies that may need to monitor the same grid assets.
