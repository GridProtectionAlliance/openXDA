	to recognize and analyze data contained in files recorded by devices such as PQ monitors or relays. If the data is
	in COMTRADE format, please use the DeviceDefinitionsExample-DFR.xml file as a template rather than
	this file. 
	
	The analytics section defines the fault distance algorithms to be used by openXDA.
    All of the following algorithms are available and will be used by default to calculate
	fault distances and generate fault distance curves. In most cases this section should be left as is, even 
	for PQ devices. If any specific algorithms are not desired they should be removed or commented out. -->
