    <!-- This device definitions example file is intended to be a model for configuring an openXDA database
	to recognize and analyze data contained in files recorded by DFRs, typically in COMTRADE format.
	A separate example file is available for PQ monitors and/or relays.
	If your data is in a PQDIF file please use the DeviceDefinitionsExample-PQ.xml file rather than this one.
	
	The analytics section defines the fault distance algorithms to be used by openXDA.
    All of the following algorithms are available and will be used by default to calculate
	fault distances and generate fault distance curves. In most cases this section should be left as is,
	but if any specific algorithms are not desired they should be removed or commented out. -->
